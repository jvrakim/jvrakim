ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
I'm a PhD candidate in Physics, specializing in the application of machine learning to particle astrophysics.
ðŸ”­ About My Research
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), where my work focuses on the fascinating field of cosmic ray physics. Specifically, I am a member of the Pierre Auger Collaboration.

My research involves using machine learning techniques to classify extensive air showers, which are cascades of secondary particles generated when an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray enters the Earth's atmosphere. This classification is crucial for understanding the properties of these mysterious cosmic messengers and their sources.

ðŸ”¬ Key Areas of Interest
Machine Learning in Physics: Applying modern ML techniques to complex datasets in fundamental physics.

Cosmic Ray Physics: Investigating the origin and nature of the highest-energy particles in the universe.

Data Analysis: Developing and implementing robust data analysis pipelines for large-scale experiments.
